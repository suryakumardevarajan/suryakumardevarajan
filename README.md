### 🚀 About Me

I'm a product-driven professional blending engineering precision with strategic vision. With 5+ years of global experience in ADAS, embedded systems, AI, and automotive software, I’m passionate about building safe, scalable, and human-centered products.

I’ve worked across startups, OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and research labs—owning everything from requirement specs and supplier meetings to sprint reviews, roadmaps, and regulatory compliance.

When I'm not decoding complex systems, you’ll find me hiking, biking, and solving sudoku.
