### 🚀 About Me

I'm a product-driven professional blending engineering precision with strategic vision. With 5+ years of global experience in ADAS, embedded systems, AI, and automotive software, I’m passionate about building and managing safe, scalable, and human-centered products.

I’ve worked across startups, OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and research labs—owning commercial agreements, requirements definition, design and development, validation, release, and launch, while ensuring quality through structured planning, cross-functional meetings, and regulatory compliance.

Off the clock, I trade product roadmaps for forest trails, debug Sudoku puzzles for fun, and cook with the precision of a systems engineer — spices included.
