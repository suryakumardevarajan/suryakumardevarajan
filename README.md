### 🚀 About Me

I'm a results-oriented professional blending engineering with management, compassion, and emotional intelligence. With over 5 years of global experience in ADAS, embedded systems, AI, and automotive software, I’m driven by the challenge of building and supporting safe, scalable, and human-centered technologies.

I’ve contributed across OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, startups, and research labs. I’ve taken ownership of commercial discussions, requirements, design, development, testing, release, and launch. My work emphasizes clear planning, cross-functional teamwork, and a strong focus on quality and compliance.

Outside work, I trade project plans for forest trails, debug Sudoku puzzles, and cook with the precision of a systems engineer (spices included lol).
